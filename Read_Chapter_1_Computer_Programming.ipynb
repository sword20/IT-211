        "A: Input, Output, Math, Secision and Repetition\n",
        "3. What do they mean (okay to copy from the book here)\n",
        "\n",
        "A: Input- Get data from the keyboard, a file, a sensor, or some other device.\n",
        "   \nOutput- Display data on the screen, or send data to a file or other device.\n",
        "   \nMath- Perform basic mathematical operations like addition and division.\n",

        "A: main\n",
        "6. Why is the method ‘main’ special?\n",
        "\n",
        "A: Because when the program runs it starts with the first statement and ends with the last statement.\n",
        "7. What is a class (how does the book define it for now?)\n",
        "\n",
        "A: It is a collection of methods.\n",

        "\n",
        "A: An interpreter read a program and executes it, simultaneously processing the lines and performing computations.\n",
        "10. What is a compiler?\n",
        "\n",
        "A: A compiler reads the entire program before the program is run.\n",

        "\n",
        "A: It is the coding language of a virtual machine.\n",

        "\n",
        "A: System.out.println() will print out the string placed in the parentheses and quotation marks with a new line at the end of it. where System.out.print() will print the string with no new line after it, so the next string will print next to your string.\n",
        "16. Why is whitespace important?\n",
        "\n",
        "A: It makes the code a lot easier to read. The code will still run without all the spaces and indents but it will be very hard to find error in code without it. It also looks more appealing visually.\n",
        "17. List two escape sequences and explain in a sentence (per escape sequence) what each one does.\n",
