        "1. What is a variable?\n",
        "\n",
        "A: It is a named location in memory that stores a value.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is an operator?  List four examples (we covered this in class, but if the answer isn't coming to you, you can find examples later in the chapter).\n",
        "\n",
        "A: Operators are symbols that represent simple computations. Examples include: The plus sign(+) for addition, a hyphen(-) for subtraction, the astrisk(*) for multiplication and the forwardslash(/) for division\n",
        "\n",
        "3. How do you declare multiple variables at once?\n",
        "\n",
        "A: Separate them with a comma\n",
        "```\n",
        "// Put your answer to question 3 on the blank line below so that it is formatted correctly:\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What are the 'case' (upper and lower case) conventions for variable names?  How do they differ from Class names?\n",
        "\n",
        "A: For variables it is conventional to start with a lowercase letter for the first word and every subsequent word is with a uppercase. Variable names are case sensitive. Class names all start with a uppercase\n",
        "\n",
        "5. When you declare a variable, what are you doing in memory (storage)?\n",
        "\n",
        "A: The declaration is storing the names, data type and value of the variable n to memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. When you assign a variable, what are you putting in that storage (memory) space?\n",
        "\n",
        "A: You are updating the value in the storage.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is a program's 'state'?\n",
        "\n",
        "A: It is the variables and values in the program.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How do you display the name of a variable instead of its value?\n",
        "\n",
        "A: You put it in quotes.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is an expression?\n",
        "\n",
        "A: A combination of variables, numbers and operators.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is an operand?  \n",
        "\n",
        "A: It is the value that operators work with.\n",

        "\n",
        "A: double\n",
        "\n",
        "12. Assigning a value to a double this way `double y = 1 / 16;` is incorrect, what is the correct way to assign it?\n",
        "\n",
        "A: double y = 1.0 / 16.0;\n",
        "\n",

        "A: Calculate as a percentage.\n",

        "\n",
        "15. How do you override the order of operations?\n",
        "\n",
        "A: Use Parentheses so the program computes that first.\n",
